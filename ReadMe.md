### Player 1 starts the game and gets their chance of 30 seconds to whack their favorite star of last seasonâ€™s election drama. But be careful, whack the wrong one and lose some points!

## How to play:

### Use the mouse to whack with the friendly 'poo' emoji the Donald and HRC. Whichever player scores the most points, wins!
